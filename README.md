Week#3 Goals

Here is the Task for Week 3:
  1. Do Analysis on the preprocessed Data.

Here are the points about how Analysis should be done:
- Distribution of Users(device_id) across States.
- Distribution of Users across Phone Brands(Consider only 10 Most used Phone Brands).
- Distribution of Users across Gender.
- Distribution of Users across Age Segments.
- Distribution of Phone Brands(Consider only 10 Most used Phone Brands) for each Age Segment, State, Gender.
- Distribution of Gender for each State, Age Segment and Phone Brand(Consider only 10 Most used Phone Brands).
- Distribution of Age Segments for each State, Gender and Phone Brand(Consider only 10 Most used Phone Brands).
  Note: While doing analysis for the above points, consider only one instance of a particular User(device_id) as a User can do multiple phone calls and considering every instance  of the same User can give misleading numbers.
- Hourly distribution of Phone Calls.
- Plot the Users on the Map using any suitable package.
